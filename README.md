# GUI with python
Create GUI by tkinter in python

This is my responsibility to create a tool to automatically predict the price of products in Siemens. And this tool will support other sales managers who do not know code. My mentor would package the models she has trained and I should read all data and models and predict the results. Then I desinged a GUI to make this process visible, showing the path and percentage of code already run.
