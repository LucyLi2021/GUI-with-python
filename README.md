Create GUI by tkinter in python

This is my responsibility to create a tool to automatically predict the price of products in Siemens. And this tool will support other sales managers who do not know code. My mentor would package the models she has trained and I should read all data and models and predict the results. Then I desinged a GUI to make this process visible, showing the path and percentage of code already run.

I really want to thank my leader because she believes me that I can do it. And I really learn a lot during this internship and also realize that I should always be positive and confident!

new.py is the code that I achieve the whole process.
